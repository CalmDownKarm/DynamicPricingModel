Recommend using anaconda and python 3.
Technically only the following packages are required
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* numpy
* sklearn
* pandas
* fbprophet


however, if the exact environment is to be replicated
use the command

conda env create -f environment.yml 

and then source activate py35 (Linux/OSX)
or activate py35 (Windows)
Code is present in a jupyter notebook
